# Monica Granbois - @MonicaG
I'm a software developer, formally at [AbeBooks](https://www.abebooks.com/). I took a career break to run around after my kids. But, I'm still coding! 

I'm currently looking for work! Please reach out if you know of any opportunities. :blush:

## Projects

- [BarbellHelper](https://barbellhelper.com/): an Apple Watch app for caluclating the weight plates to put on a barbell. 
- [BC Dev Ex Bot](https://twitter.com/bcdevexbot): a twitter bot that tweets new opportunities posted to [https://bcdevexchange.org/](https://bcdevexchange.org/)
